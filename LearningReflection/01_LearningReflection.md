> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?

- It was my first time thoroughly testing several pages of an application. I found it quite interesting to gain insight into how it works in reality and to understand how testers typically carry out their tasks.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.

-

In order to write the test cases, I tried my best to follow the instructions of the assignment while applying my knowledge and the materials from the lessons. I described the steps for the test cases in a concise manner, ensuring clarity and using the variables that I had previously declared.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management.

-

I am quite new to this topic and I didn't have the necessary experience to recommend any others tools or management because I have tried just one.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?

-

In order to edit the files I used Visual Code.

## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?

- I encountered a problem with the link of the last page Issue_Page which was unreachable for me so I decided to contact the teacher but I didn't get any answers

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?

-

No I didn't encounter any issues with github. I already used it for others project previously so I am quite familiar to it.

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )

-

In the future if I need to automate theses test cases I would use Cypress because it has a clean and easy to understand syntax and offers a a good support for Javascript.

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing

- Automation,English,Selenium, Bug detection,Regresion test, Robot Framework,Manual tests, Software testing

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?

-

I would write these hard skills :
-Bug detection
-Selenium
-Automation testing tools
-manual testing skills

and for the soft skills :

-efficient communication
-analytical mind
-problem solving thinking
-attention to detail

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas?

- I want to thank you for all the materials you shared with us. They were very interesting and useful for completing this assignment and for learning the basics of software testing. I am convinced that this project helped me apply my theoretical knowledge in practice. Although I feel that a lot of the theory I learned during this semester didnâ€™t directly serve this project, it is still important to know and understand it. The only suggestion I have regarding the content of the materials is to include more summaries or perhaps flashcards, as the lessons are sometimes very long and contain a lot of information.
